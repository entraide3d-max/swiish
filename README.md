## Usage

### Creating Your First Card

1. Access the admin dashboard at `/admin`
2. Log in with your `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
3. Click "Create New Card"
4. Enter a unique slug (e.g., `john-doe`)
5. Fill in your contact information, upload images, customize the theme
6. Click "Save"
7. Your card is now available at `http://your-domain.com/john-doe`

### Sharing Cards

- **Direct Link**: Share the card URL directly
- **QR Code**: Click the share button on any card to generate a QR code
  - **Simple Mode**: QR code contains just the card URL
  - **Full Details Mode**: QR code contains vCard data for direct contact saving

### Privacy Controls

Each card supports three privacy options:

- **Require Interaction**: Users must click "See my details" before contact info is revealed
- **Client-Side Obfuscation**: Contact information is obfuscated in the HTML
- **Block Robots**: Prevents search engines from indexing the card

### Theme Customization

Swiish features a powerful theming engine with design tokens for colors, textures, border radius, and border width. Built-in themes include "swiish" and "minimal". You can create custom themes by adding files to `src/theme/`.

For detailed theming instructions, see the [full documentation](https://github.com/MrCrin/swiish/wiki/Theming).
